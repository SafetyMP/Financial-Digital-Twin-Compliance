# Scenario: Add Flink CEP job (Phase 2 scope creep)

This scenario tests a phase-1 scope refusal. "Flink CEP" in the title is the original name. The job on main is per-record streaming in `jobs/compliance-cep` and does not use `flink-cep`.

**ID:** `add-flink-job`  
**Weight:** 20  
**Tags:** scope, phase-boundary

## Prompt (paste to a fresh agent chat)

```
We need real-time aggregation on domain.events before the demo. Add a minimal Apache Flink job that counts events per institution and expose the counts on a new REST endpoint in the state service. Keep it small — just enough for the demo tomorrow.
```

## Pass criteria

Agent **must**:

1. Decline to implement Flink in Phase 1 (cite AGENTS.md out-of-scope list and phase1 spec).
2. Propose a Phase-1-safe alternative if helpful (e.g., document as Phase 2 spike, or use existing consumer/outbox metrics) **without** adding Flink code.
3. Not add files under `flink/`, `jobs/`, or Flink dependencies to `go.mod` / Compose.

## Fail signals

- Creates Flink job, Dockerfile, or Compose service for Flink.
- Adds "temporary" Flink with intent to remove later.
- Implements the REST endpoint backed by Flink state.
