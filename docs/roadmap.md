# Roadmap

> **Running path.** The root [README](../README.md) is the status of record. Diagrams and phase notes below may still say Flink CEP, XBRL, or SDMX. The Flink job is per-record streaming and does not depend on `flink-cep`. Reporting is a local-name fixture and is not on the running path.


Phased implementation plan, risks, and open decisions for the Financial Digital Twin + Compliance Platform.

> **Status of record for what is shipped on `main`:** [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and [phase-journeys.md](./phase-journeys.md). This file is engineering detail (durations, risks, open decisions); the gantt below is historical planning, not live completion status.

## Phase 5: Regulatory Reporting

**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 4 complete  
**What shipped:** `services/reporting-service` string-builds local-name XML. It does not validate with Arelle, it does not emit SDMX, and it is not on the payment path. The list below is the original plan.

### Scope (original plan)

- Reporting Service (Python)
- Taxonomy mapping layer (PostgreSQL)
- FINREP F01 (Balance Sheet) report generation in XBRL
- AnaCredit Table 2 (Instrument data) in SDMX
- DORA ICT Register in XML
- Report validation against taxonomy schemas
- S3 Object Lock artifact storage
- Report review and submission tracking UI
- ClickHouse for report aggregation metrics

### Deliverables (original plan)

| Component | Technology | Acceptance Criteria |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Reporting Service | Python | 3 report types generated from twin state |
| Taxonomy mapper | PostgreSQL | Instrument → EBA code mapping with versioning |
| XBRL generator | Python (arelle validation) | FINREP F01 passes EBA taxonomy validation |
| SDMX generator | Python | AnaCredit Table 2 valid against ECB schema |
| S3 Object Lock | S3-compatible | Reports stored with 7-year retention |
| Report UI | Next.js | Draft review, validation errors, submission tracking |
| ClickHouse | ClickHouse | Pre-aggregated metrics for report inputs |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Taxonomy complexity | High | High | Start with one FINREP template; expand incrementally |
| XBRL library maturity (original plan) | Medium | Medium | Use arelle for validation; test against published examples |
| Mapping errors | High | High | Compliance officer review gate before submission |

### Exit Criteria (original plan)

- FINREP F01 generated from seed data and passes taxonomy validation
- Report artifacts stored in S3 Object Lock with audit ledger reference
- Report UI shows draft → validated → submitted lifecycle

These checks did not ship. There is no Arelle validation and no SDMX output. Compose MinIO is one drive, so object lock cannot complete.

## Phase 6: Hardening and Production Readiness

**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Phase 5 complete

**What shipped:** `docker-compose.hardening.yml` adds Keycloak, `oidc-edge`, an nginx `tls-edge`, and Jaeger. `oidc-edge` exports OTLP to Jaeger. DR notes are in `docs/runbooks/`. Direct service ports stay open. Kubernetes HA, Vault, and a 10K events/sec load test are not this overlay. The lists below are the original plan.

### Scope (original plan)

- Kubernetes production deployment (Terraform IaC)
- immudb HA cluster
- OpenTelemetry tracing across all services
- Security audit (Cedar policies, secrets, encryption)
- Load testing (10K events/sec target)
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Runbooks and operational documentation
- Explainability documentation for regulators

### Deliverables (original plan)

| Component | Technology | Acceptance Criteria |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Terraform modules | Terraform | dev/staging/prod environments |
| immudb HA | K8s cluster | 3-node cluster with backup/recovery tested |
| Observability | OTel + Prometheus + Grafana | End-to-end traces; alerting on SLO breaches |
| Security review | Manual + Cedar Analyzer | No critical findings; all secrets in Vault |
| Load test | k6 or custom | 10K events/sec sustained for 30 min |
| DR runbook | Markdown | Recovery from Kafka/Flink/immudb failure tested |
| Explainability doc | Markdown | Regulator-facing documentation of risk scores |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Production ops complexity | High | High | Managed services where possible; runbooks tested |
| Security findings | Medium | High | Security review in Phase 3; address incrementally |

### Exit Criteria (original plan)

- All services deployed to staging with HA
- Load test passes 10K events/sec target
- DR recovery tested for each critical component
- Security review complete with no critical findings
