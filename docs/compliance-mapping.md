# Compliance Mapping

> **Running path.** The root [README](../README.md) is the status of record. Diagrams and phase notes below may still say Flink CEP, XBRL, or SDMX. The Flink job is per-record streaming and does not depend on `flink-cep`. Reporting is a local-name fixture and is not on the running path.


Maps target regulatory regimes to platform rules, real-time monitoring checks, audit requirements, and regulatory reports.

See also: [domain-model.md](./domain-model.md), [architecture.md](./architecture.md), [data-flow.md](./data-flow.md).

## Overview

Each regime is decomposed into four platform capabilities:

| Capability | Platform Component | Output |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Rules** | Cedar policies + Zen decision models | `RuleDecision` |
| **Monitoring** | Flink CEP patterns | `ComplianceAlert` |
| **Audit** | immudb ledger + S3 artifacts | `AuditEntry` |
| **Reporting** | Reporting Service | `RegulatoryReport` (XBRL/SDMX) |

## Rule Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Draft: Author creates rule
  Draft --> InReview: Submit for review
  InReview --> Approved: Compliance officer approves
  InReview --> Draft: Rejected with comments
  Approved --> Active: Deploy to engine (effective date)
  Active --> Deprecated: Superseded by new version
  Deprecated --> [*]
  Active --> Suspended: Emergency suspension
  Suspended --> Active: Reinstate
```

### CI Pipeline Gates

1. **Schema validation** — Rule conforms to Cedar/JDM schema
2. **Unit tests** — Fixture inputs produce expected outputs
3. **Cedar Analyzer** — Formal verification (Tier 1 only)
4. **Regression suite** — Full rule set re-evaluated against historical data
5. **Approval gate** — Compliance officer sign-off required for `Critical` and `Blocking` rules

## Semantic Mapping Layer

The reporting service uses a **taxonomy mapping layer** to translate twin entity attributes to regulatory codes:

| Twin Attribute | FINREP | COREP | AnaCredit | EMIR | DORA |
|----------------|--------|-------|-----------|------|------|
| `instrumentType=Loan` | F0610 | C07 SA | Table 2 | — | — |
| `instrumentType=Derivative` | F0610 | C08 | — | TR | — |
| `entityType=ICTProvider` | — | — | — | — | ICT_REG |
| `contractType=ICTOutsourcing` | — | — | — | — | ICT_REG |
| `accountType=Nostro` | F0010 | — | — | — | — |

Mapping tables are versioned and stored in PostgreSQL with effective date ranges. Changes require compliance review.

---

## Open Items

1. **Jurisdiction-specific variants** — National discretions may require country-specific rule variants (e.g., UK EMIR post-Brexit)
2. **Taxonomy version management** — EBA taxonomy updates (annual) require mapping layer migration
3. **Consolidation scope rules** — Group vs solo reporting may require duplicate rule sets
4. **Cross-regime deduplication** — Same underlying check (e.g., counterparty exposure) may appear in COREP, EMIR, and Internal — need shared rule references
