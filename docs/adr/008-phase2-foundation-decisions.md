# ADR-008: Phase 2 Foundation Decisions (D10–D14)

The monitoring job on main is per-record streaming in `jobs/compliance-cep`. `pom.xml` has no `flink-cep` artifact. "Flink CEP" in the context below is the original decision text.

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-06-13  
**Deciders**: Platform Architecture Team  
**Implements**: [phase2-implementation-spec.md](../phase2-implementation-spec.md)

## Context

Phase 2 adds real-time compliance monitoring (Flink CEP), Redis features, Alert Service, WebSocket delivery, and a Next.js alert console. Several choices affect local dev, CI, and how closely Phase 2 matches the long-term architecture in [ADR-001](./001-kafka-flink-streaming.md).

| ID | Decision | Phase 2 impact |
|----|----------|----------------|
| D10 | Flink runtime (dev vs staging) | Compose vs Kubernetes Operator |
| D11 | Alert durability store | PostgreSQL vs immudb |
| D12 | Threshold evaluation location | Flink inline vs Decision Service |
| D13 | Payments ingested via Debezium CDC | Reuses Phase 1 ingestion pattern; avoids a one-off Kafka producer that bypasses schema and ordering guarantees. |
| D14 | JSON Kafka payloads in Phase 2 dev | Matches Phase 1 outbox; Avro schemas registered for CI compat until staging wire encoding |

## Decision

### D10 — Flink mini-cluster in Compose for dev/CI; Operator for shared staging

**Decision**: Run Flink JobManager + TaskManager in **Docker Compose** for local development and GitHub Actions. Use **Flink Kubernetes Operator** only for shared staging/production (documented in deployment guide; not required for Phase 2 exit criteria).

**Rationale**: Consistent with ADR-007 D4 (local-first). Avoids K8s dependency for every contributor while preserving ADR-001 production target.

### D11 — PostgreSQL for alert persistence; immudb in Phase 3

**Decision**: Alert Service stores `ComplianceAlert` rows in **PostgreSQL**. Do **not** write to immudb in Phase 2. `evidenceRef` on alert events may be null.

**Rationale**: Phase 3 introduces Audit Service + immudb for tamper-evident records. Dual-write in Phase 2 adds failure modes without audit UI.

### D12 — Inline CEP thresholds in Flink; Zen deferred

**Decision**: Implement `INT-M001`, `INT-M002`, and `BASEL-M001` thresholds as **Flink job configuration** (env vars). Do not call Decision Service / GoRules Zen on the hot path in Phase 2.

**Rationale**: Pattern tuning with compliance officers does not require Zen until rule versioning and CI fixtures land in Phase 3. Reduces latency and service count.

### D13 — Payments ingested via Debezium CDC

**Decision**: Add `payments` table to mock core banking; extend Debezium to publish `domain.events.public.payments`. Flink consumes CDC events for velocity detection.

**Rationale**: Reuses Phase 1 ingestion pattern; avoids a one-off Kafka producer that bypasses schema and ordering guarantees.

### D14 — JSON Kafka payloads in Phase 2 dev; Avro on staging upgrade path

**Decision**: Flink and Alert Service exchange `EventEnvelope` messages as **UTF-8 JSON strings** on Kafka topics in local dev and CI. Avro schemas remain registered for contract documentation and BACKWARD compatibility CI; Confluent wire encoding is required before shared staging/production promotion.

**Rationale**: Phase 1 State Service outbox already publishes JSON envelopes. Wiring Avro serializers through Flink and Alert Service adds dependency surface without blocking pattern validation. Schema files and registry checks prevent silent field drift.

**Migration path**: Phase 3 staging hardening replaces `SimpleStringSchema` with Schema Registry Avro serializers and sets `EventEnvelope.payload` to a JSON string (not embedded object) per `event-envelope.avsc`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Phase 2 can be developed and CI-verified with `docker compose up` only.
- Clear upgrade path: swap Flink deployment to Operator without changing job JAR contract.
- Alert API and UI can ship before audit ledger complexity.

### Negative

- Compose Flink differs from Operator-managed production (savepoint deployment, HA).
- Inline thresholds duplicate logic that Zen will own in Phase 3 — plan migration to `ruleCode` + Decision Service lookup.
- Alerts are not tamper-evident until Phase 3 immudb integration.

## Alternatives Considered

| Decision | Alternative | Why rejected for Phase 2 |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| D10 | K8s Operator only | Blocks local dev and CI without a cluster |
| D11 | immudb from day one | Requires Audit Service and verification UI not in Phase 2 scope |
| D12 | Zen for all thresholds | Adds service dependency and latency before patterns are validated |
| D13 | Script publishes to Kafka directly | Skips CDC; weaker parity with production ingestion |
